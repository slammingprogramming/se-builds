# Build Process for SE-Builds

## Overview
To maintain quality and consistency, follow these steps to create and submit your builds to SE-Builds. Each build should be functional, well-documented, and tested for cross-platform compatibility.

## Build Creation
1. **Conceptualize**: Plan out your build. Determine its purpose (mining rig, combat ship, base, etc.) and functionality.
2. **Design**: Start with a basic structure and build out the features you want to include. Keep platform limitations in mind.
3. **Optimize**: Minimize block count and ensure performance by avoiding unnecessary elements or complex scripts.

## Testing
1. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Test your build on PC and, if possible, on Xbox and PlayStation. Use [mod.io](https://mod.io/g/spaceengineers) for console testing.
2. **Survival Mode Testing**: Ensure your build functions effectively in survival mode. Resources, power, and systems should be balanced for survival gameplay.
3. **Performance Testing**: Monitor the build’s performance in different environments, checking for frame rate stability and potential lag.

## Documentation
1. **Add README**: Every build should include a `README.md` file. Provide:
   - Name and description of the build.
   - Key features and intended use cases.
   - Platform compatibility notes.
2. **Add Images**: Include screenshots showing key features and design elements.

## Submission
1. **Pull Request**: Submit your build via a pull request. Ensure it’s in the correct directory, with proper naming conventions.
2. **Review**: Project maintainers will review your build for compatibility, functionality, and adherence to guidelines.
3. **Approval**: Once approved, your build will be added to SE-Builds.
