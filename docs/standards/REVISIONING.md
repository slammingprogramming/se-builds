# Revisioning Policy for SE-Builds

## Versioning Format
We use Semantic Versioning (SemVer) for each build, in the format `vX.Y.Z` where:
   - `X` is the **major** version for large changes or redesigns.
   - `Y` is the **minor** version for significant feature additions or improvements.
   - `Z` is the **patch** version for bug fixes or small changes.

## When to Update Versions
1. **Major Update** (vX.0.0): When there is a large overhaul or rework of the buildâ€™s structure or functionality.
2. **Minor Update** (vX.Y.0): For adding new features or enhancements that improve functionality without major overhauls.
3. **Patch Update** (vX.Y.Z): For small fixes, optimizations, or minor adjustments.

## Revision History
Each build should include a `CHANGELOG.md` file in its directory to track updates. Record changes with version numbers, dates, and a description of what was modified.
